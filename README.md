# R3-SoftwareTask1-AnuramThirumoli
Arduino Uno program written for R3 Software Task 1. Displays a number between 0 and 99 to two 7-segment displays based on a potentiometers output/position. Uses multiplexing instead of using two CD4511 7-segment decoders.

**1. How is the project powered?** \
The project is powered through the Arduino Uno's built-in 5V output and its ground. There are wires (see red for 5V and black for ground) connecting all the breadboards in the project to a common power and ground. It is important to have a common ground so that the project references the same point for voltage measurements.

**2. How is the potentiometer output measured by the Arduino Uno?**
